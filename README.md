# MorseCode
Either plays morse code or transates morse code depending on input

This was a project for a company during a coding competition

# Runthorugh:
The program attempts to read the output file as input.
if file is not present or empty, user input is taken

If there are letters in the input, the input is translated to morse code and the corresponding dash dot wav files are played.
Otherwise, the morse code is translated into the corresponding letters

the result is then saved into the output file

This program was made under time pressure with numerous other challenges also needing to be completed, so readability/efficiancy may be slightly lacking when compared to a normal project.
